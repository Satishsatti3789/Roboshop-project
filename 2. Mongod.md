**Developer has chosen the database MongoDB. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.**
```
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mongo.repo
```
**Add below content** 
```
[mongodb-org-4.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```
**Install Mongod**
```
dnf install mongodb-org -y
```
**Start & Enable MongoDB Service**
```
systemctl enable mongod 
systemctl start mongod
```
**Note** : Usually MongoDB opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server, So we need to change the config accordingly.

Update listen address from **127.0.0.1** to **0.0.0.0** in **/etc/mongod.conf**

**Restart the service to make the changes effected**
```
systemctl restart mongod
```


# Some Additional points

In case above repo code not working use below 
```
[mongodb-org-4.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/8/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc
enabled=1
```
**$releasever**
Ensure Correct Substitution: For **$releasever** to be correctly substituted, make sure your package manager is properly configured. For yum, this usually works out-of-the-box. For dnf, which is used by default in Fedora and newer RHEL/CentOS versions, it works similarly.
Manual Override: If you need to manually specify a version or if $releasever does not resolve correctly, you can replace $releasever with the specific version number of your OS.

**Trobuleshooting commands**
```
sudo journalctl -u mongod
